# Money Recognition
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/cu86hr3s9cuxa3k4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/boginw/moneyrecognition)

This is a semester project at Aalborg University. This tool was built with the mindset of giving blind or visually impaired people an ability to tell USD banknotes apart. As this is a desktop application, built for Windows, we recognize that this program does not solve the issue at hand fully, but it is a start.

## Getting started
Plain and simple, just clone the repository, and open `SiftSharp.sln`.

their own licenses:

 * Use default MSDN coding style (this includes PascalCase for methods).
 * Great doumentation of code.
 * Give a short, clear title that describes pull request.
